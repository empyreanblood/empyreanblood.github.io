            <p>Before the great calamity, there were three main producers of drones. 
                These companies competed in the creation and distrubution of these drones, 
                it seemed almost every person had at least 2 drones in their household.
                While they all form the same foundation, these companies specialized 
                in their own fields. <strong>JcJenson</strong>, specialized in terraforming 
                planets and held drones responsible for labor. <strong>ZNA Systems</strong>, 
                performing military roles and filling in for the lives lost in previous wars. 
                <strong>Bliss</strong>, for the comfort of humanity, specializing in societal roles.
